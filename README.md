# Keymaps
#### Navigation

 * `,z` - go to previous buffer (:bp)
 * `,x` - go to next buffer (:bn)
 * `Cmd-j` and `Cmd-k` to move up and down roughly by functions (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `Ctrl-o` - Old cursor position - this is a standard mapping but very useful, so included here
 * `Ctrl-i` - opposite of Ctrl-O (again, this is standard)

#### Search/Code Navigation

 * `,f` - instantly Find definition of class (must have exuberant ctags installed)
 * `,F` - same as `,f` but in a vertical split
 * `,gf` or `Ctrl-f` - same as vim normal gf (go to file), but in a vertical split (works with file.rb:123 line numbers also)
 * `gF` - standard vim mapping, here for completeness (go to file at line number)
 * `,k` - Search the current word under the cursor and show results in quickfix window
 * `,K` - Grep the current word up to next exclamation point (useful for ruby foo! methods)
 * `Cmd-*` - highlight all occurrences of current word (similar to regular `*` except doesn't move)
 * `,hl` - toggle search highlight on and off
 * `,gg` or `,ag` - Grep command line, type between quotes. Uses Ag Silver Searcher.
 * After searching with `,gg` you can navigate the results with `Ctrl-x` and `Ctrl-z` (or standard vim `:cn` and `:cp`)
 * `,gd` - Grep def (greps for 'def [function name]') when cursor is over the function name
 * `,gcf` - Grep Current File to find references to the current file
 * `//` - clear the search
 * `,,w` (alias `,<esc>`) or `,,b` (alias `,<shift-esc>`) - EasyMotion, a vimperator style tool that highlights jump-points on the screen and lets you type to get there.
 * `,mc` - mark this word for MultiCursor (like sublime). Use `Ctrl-n` (next), `Ctrl-p` (prev), `Ctrl-x`(skip) to add more cursors, then do normal vim things like edit the word.
 * `gK` - Opens the documentation for the word under the cursor.
 * Spacebar - Sneak - type two characters to move there in a line. Kind of like vim's `f` but more accurate.
 * `:Gsearch foo` - global search, then do your normal `%s/search/replace/g` and follow up with `:Greplace` to replace across all files. When done use `:wall` to write all the files.


#### File Navigation

 * `,t` - CtrlP fuzzy file selector
 * `,b` - CtrlP buffer selector - great for jumping to a file you already have open
 * `Cmd-Shift-M` - jump to method - CtrlP tag search within current buffer
 * `,jm` jump to models. Other `,j` mappings: `,jc` for controllers, `,jh` for helpers, etc. If you think of a concept and a letter, we've got you covered.
 * `Cmd-Shift-N` - NERDTree toggle (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `Ctrl-\` - Show current file in NERDTree
 * `Cmd-Shift-P` - Clear CtrlP cache

#### Better keystrokes for common editing commands

 * Ctrl-Space to autocomplete. Tab for snipmate snippets.
 * `,#` `,"` `,'` `,]` `,)` `,}` to surround a word in these common wrappers. the # does #{ruby interpolation}. works in visual mode (thanks @cj). Normally these are done with something like `ysw#`
 * `Cmd-'`, `Cmd-"`, `Cmd-]`, `Cmd-)`, etc to change content inside those surrounding marks. You don't have to be inside them (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `,.` to go to last edit location (same as `'.`) because the apostrophe is hard on the pinky
 * `,ci` to change inside any set of quotes/brackets/etc

#### Tabs, Windows, Splits

 * Use `Cmd-1` thru `Cmd-9` to switch to a specific tab number (like iTerm and Chrome) - and tabs have been set up to show numbers (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `Ctrl-h,l,j,k` - to move left, right, down, up between splits. This also works between vim and tmux splits thanks to `vim-tmux-navigator`.
 * `Q` - Intelligent Window Killer. Close window `wincmd c` if there are multiple windows to same buffer, or kill the buffer `bwipeout` if this is the last window into it.
 * `vv` - vertical split (`Ctrl-w,v`)
 * `ss` - horizontal split (`Ctrl-w,s`)
 * `,qo` - open quickfix window (this is where output from Grep goes)
 * `,qc` - close quickfix

#### Utility

 * `Ctrl-p` after pasting - Use `p` to paste and `Ctrl-p` to cycle through previous pastes. Provided by YankRing.
 * `,yr` - view the yankring - a list of your previous copy commands. also you can paste and hit `ctrl-p` for cycling through previous copy commands
 * `crs`, `crc`, `cru` via abolish.vim, coerce to snake_case, camelCase, and UPPERCASE. There are more `:help abolish`
 * `:NR` - NarrowRgn - use this on a bit of selected text to create a new split with just that text. Do some work on it, then :wq it to get the results back.
 * `,ig` - toggle visual indentation guides
 * `,cf` - Copy Filename of current file (full path) into system (not vi) paste buffer
 * `,cn` - Copy Filename of current file (name only, no path)
 * `,yw` - yank a word from anywhere within the word (so you don't have to go to the beginning of it)
 * `,ow` - overwrite a word with whatever is in your yank buffer - you can be anywhere on the word. saves having to visually select it
 * `,ocf` - open changed files (stolen from @garybernhardt). open all files with git changes in splits
 * `,w` - strip trailing whitespaces
 * `sj` - split a line such as a hash {:foo => {:bar => :baz}} into a multiline hash (j = down)
 * `sk` - unsplit a link (k = up)
 * `,he` - Html Escape
 * `,hu` - Html Unescape
 * `,hp` - Html Preview (open in Safari)
 * `Cmd-Shift-A` - align things (type a character/expression to align by, works in visual mode or by itself) (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `:ColorToggle` - turn on #abc123 color highlighting (useful for css)
 * `:Gitv` - Git log browsers
 * `,hi` - show current Highlight group. if you don't like the color of something, use this, then use `hi! link [groupname] [anothergroupname]` in your vimrc.after to remap the color. You can see available colors using `:hi`
 * `,gt` - Go Tidy - tidy up your html code (works on a visual selection)
 * `:Wrap` - wrap long lines (e.g. when editing markdown files)
 * `Cmd-/` - toggle comments (usually gcc from tComment) (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `gcp` (comment a paragraph)

#### Rails & Ruby

 * `,vv` and `,cc` to switch between view and controller - these are maps to :Rcontroller and :Rview. Explore the :R<Tab> family of commands for more fun from rails.vim!
 * `,rs` and `,rl` to run rspec or a spec line in iTerm (check iTerm window for results)
 * `,ss` and `,sl` for the same using `spring rspec` which makes your Rails specs faster by caching the Rails env (must have spring gem installed)
 * vim-ruby-refactoring - try `,rem`, `,rel` to extract methods or let statements
 * `Ctrl-s` - Open related spec in a split. Similar to :A and :AV from rails.vim but is also aware of the fast_spec dir and faster to type
 * `:Bopen [gem name]` to navigate to a gem (@tpope/vim-bundler)
 * `,gcp` - Grep Current Partial to find references to the current view partial
 * `,orb` - outer ruby block. takes you one level up from nested blocks (great for rspec)

#### Vim Dev

 * `,vc` - (Vim Command) copies the command under your cursor and executes it in vim. Great for testing single line changes to vimrc.
 * `,vr` - (Vim Reload) source current file as a vim file
